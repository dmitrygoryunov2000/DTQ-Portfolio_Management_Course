Dan the Quant - Quant Investor Course

"Don't put all your eggs on one basket"

Learning goals:
    - Understand that the concept of risk must include a way to measure the co-movement of prices
    - Find out why diversification can be the best thing in Investment Management (the only free lunch)
    - Consider Markowitz proposition to see the portfolio construction problem as trade off between profits and risk
    - Master the concept of leverage to build optimal portfolios according to investors risk tolerance
    - Investigate some implementation details about portfolios (what happens outside of the classroom)

The classical, Nobel Prized way of constructing portfolios is not the only way, but the more you use it and think about it
the more you value its practicallity. Moreover, it makes for a really hard-to-beat benchmark when trying to find better methods.
