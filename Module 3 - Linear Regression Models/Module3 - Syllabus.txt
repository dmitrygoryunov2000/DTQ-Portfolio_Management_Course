“Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.” - William Edwards Deming

Linear regression is just finding the best-fitting line through your data points.

Once that line has been properly identified we can use it to explain past observations and to predict future observations
within its limitations, of course.

Learning goals:
- Estimate a simple line that fits the data
- Estimate multidimensional linear shape that fits the data
- Analyze the results and assess how much we can trust in the result
- Apply it to financial instruments to have a measure of sensitivity to the change in other variables
