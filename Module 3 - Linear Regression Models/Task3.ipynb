    "# Task Description #\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a mini-project where students must apply the knowledge from the past module. The objective is to create a multiple linear regression model using financial and economic data downloaded from Yahoo Finance or the Federal Reserve APIs (e.g., AAPL stock returns vs. a benchmark index, interest rates, exchange rates, annualized volatility, or returns of other stocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "The student must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Formulate a hypothesis (Why are these variables being chosen?).\n",
    "2) Estimate the regression coefficients.\n",
    "3) Compute the $R^2$ and the Adjusted $R^2$, and compare them.\n",
    "4) Conduct statistical significance tests (including joint significance).\n",
    "5) Calculate the fitted values and residuals.\n",
    "6) Perform at least three diagnostic tests on the residuals (e.g., are they normally distributed?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit ###\n",
    "Students may receive additional credit if they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include at least two exploratory/pre-analysis plots (Scatter Plots, Box Plots, etc.).\n",
    "- Apply Weighted Least Squares (WLS).\n",
    "- Extend the analysis to a multivariate regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook must include the procedures and code, and it must be delivered to the professor via email."
