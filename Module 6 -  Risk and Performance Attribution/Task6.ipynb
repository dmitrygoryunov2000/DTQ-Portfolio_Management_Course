    "# Task Description #\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a mini-project where students must apply the knowledge from the previous module. Up to this point, students have created several portfolios based on different strategies (hopefully saved on their PCs). Now, it is time to evaluate these portfolios’ performance using the attribution techniques studied in Module 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "The student must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Select one portfolio consisting of at least 5 stocks. If you do not already have one, create a new portfolio using the methodology of your choice (ensure that each stock belongs to a different sector of the U.S. economy).\n",
    "2) Construct a benchmark for comparison. One option is to create an equal-weighted portfolio using the sector ETFs corresponding to the chosen stocks.\n",
    "3) Perform the Brinson–Fachler attribution using the methodology studied previously.\n",
    "4) Perform the Brinson–Hood–Beebower (BHB) attribution. Create the four portfolios and compare them using the Analytics Table function.\n",
    "5) Apply the X-Sigma-Rho risk attribution model.\n",
    "6) Summarize and explain the main findings. Is your strategy better or worse than the benchmark? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit ###\n",
    "Students may receive additional credit if they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create plots to visualize the attribution results.\n",
    "- Compare the results across the three attribution frameworks and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "- Perform a sensitivity analysis (e.g., how results change if weights or benchmark definitions are slightly modified).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook must include the procedures and code, and it must be delivered to the professor via email."
