    "# Task Description #\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a mini-project where students must apply the knowledge from the previous module. The objective is to work with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), estimate Beta coefficients, and construct a Betting Against Beta (BAB) strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "The student must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Select between 10 and 20 stocks with at least 10 years of historical trading data (approximately 2,520 observations). The choice of stocks must be justified.\n",
    "2) Estimate the Alpha, Beta, and Sigma coefficients for each stock (rolling estimates are not required).\n",
    "3) Plot the distributions of each coefficient (do they approximate a normal distribution?).\n",
    "4) Calculate the weights of the BAB portfolio (paying attention to look-ahead bias).\n",
    "5) Construct the BAB portfolio and compare its performance to a benchmark (Is this a good strategy? Would you invest in it?).\n",
    "6) Estimate the Beta of the overall portfolio (What does this reveal about the portfolio?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit ###\n",
    "Students may receive additional credit if they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply the time-weighted version of the CAPM.\n",
    "- Plot the Security Market Line (SML) for at least one of the selected stocks and interpret the result.\n",
    "- Compare the BAB strategy with a long-only Beta strategy.\n",
    "\n",
