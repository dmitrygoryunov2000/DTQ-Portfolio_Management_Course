    "# Task Description #\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a mini-project where students must apply the knowledge from the previous module. The objective is to analyze the significance of different financial factors using ETFs. Several companies construct ETFs based on factor investing strategies. Students may use the Value and Size ETFs introduced in previous notebooks, or explore alternatives such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Momentum: iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM)\n",
    "- Quality: iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL)\n",
    "- Low Volatility: iShares MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV)\n",
    "- Dividend Yield: Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "The student must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Select between 5 and 10 stocks to perform a naïve factor model.\n",
    "2) Choose between 3 and 5 factors as explanatory variables (the market premium may be included) and explain the rationale for their selection. If using traditional factors (Size, Value, Momentum), they can be downloaded from the Fama and French database. Additional factors from the same source may also be included.\n",
    "3) If using ETFs, justify their selection and orthogonalize them by regressing each ETF against the market premium. Use the residuals (residual returns) as the factor risk premium.\n",
    "4) Estimate the Beta coefficients for each stock and conduct a significance analysis. Which factors are statistically relevant for which stocks?\n",
    "5) Test for multicollinearity among the chosen factors and discuss its implications.\n",
    "6) Run a Fama–MacBeth regression and plot the estimated risk premiums against the model inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit ###\n",
    "Students may receive additional credit if they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Portfolio Based on the finding of this factor model and present the results of the created strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook must include the procedures and code, and it must be delivered to the professor via email."
